; ====== Basic Settings ======
; Maximum error reporting level
error_reporting = E_ALL
display_errors = On
display_startup_errors = On
log_errors = On
html_errors = On

; Logging errors (file path in container)
; If you want to log errors to a file, you can set:
; error_log = /var/log/php_errors.log

; ====== Memory and Execution Time ======
memory_limit = 512M                ; Increase for development, but adjust down in production
max_execution_time = 300           ; Extend to 5 minutes, useful for longer scripts or setup tasks
max_input_time = 300               ; Extend input parsing time, in seconds

; ====== File Upload and Post Limits ======
upload_max_filesize = 100M         ; Allow larger file uploads, adjust as needed
post_max_size = 100M               ; Allow larger POST data for uploads
max_file_uploads = 20              ; Allow up to 20 simultaneous file uploads

; ====== Session Configuration ======
session.gc_maxlifetime = 1440      ; Session garbage collection time in seconds (24 minutes)
session.save_path = "/tmp"         ; Save sessions to temporary directory (in the container)

; ====== Realpath Cache ======
; Helps with performance by caching paths, particularly beneficial for applications with many includes
realpath_cache_size = 4M
realpath_cache_ttl = 600

; ====== Opcode Cache (for PHP 8) ======
; Improve performance by caching compiled scripts
opcache.enable = 1
opcache.memory_consumption = 128
opcache.interned_strings_buffer = 8
opcache.max_accelerated_files = 4000
opcache.validate_timestamps = 1    ; Useful for development to reload changed scripts
opcache.revalidate_freq = 0        ; Disable caching intervals in development

; ====== Xdebug Configuration (for Debugging) ======
; Xdebug is very useful for step debugging in development
; Make sure the Xdebug extension is installed (`pecl install xdebug`)
zend_extension=xdebug.so
xdebug.mode=off                   ; Disable by default, enable when debugging is needed
xdebug.start_with_request=no       ; Only start debugging when manually triggered
xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal ; Connect to the host machine from the container
xdebug.client_port=9003            ; Default port for Xdebug 3
xdebug.max_nesting_level=256       ; Prevents issues with deep nesting in complex applications

; ====== Miscellaneous Development Settings ======
default_socket_timeout = 60        ; Adjusts the default socket timeout
mysqli.reconnect = On              ; Automatically reconnects MySQL connections
display_errors = On                ; Ensure errors are displayed for development
log_errors = On                    ; Log errors for debugging purposes
html_errors = On                   ; Makes error messages clickable for easy navigation in the browser

; ====== Mail Configuration (for Dockerized Mailhog) ======
; Redirects all mail to Mailhog in Docker for testing email functionality without sending real emails
sendmail_path = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i -S mailhog:1025"

max_input_vars = 5000
